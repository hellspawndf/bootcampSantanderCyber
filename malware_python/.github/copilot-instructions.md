# AI Agent Instructions for Ransomware Testing Project

## Project Overview
This is a cybersecurity educational project focused on understanding ransomware behavior in a controlled environment. The project contains a simple ransomware simulation for educational purposes only.

## Project Structure
```
.
├── ransomware.py      # Main ransomware simulation script
└── test_files/        # Directory containing test files for simulation
    ├── meudocimportante  # Test document file
    └── senhas           # Test credentials file
```

## Development Guidelines

### Security and Ethics
- This is an **educational project only**
- All testing must be performed in the isolated test environment
- Never modify the code to target real systems or files
- Keep all simulated malware behavior contained to the `test_files` directory

### Code Organization
- All core ransomware simulation logic should be in `ransomware.py`
- Test files should remain in the `test_files` directory
- Use clear, descriptive variable names that indicate the educational nature of the code

### Testing
- Always test any changes with the provided test files only
- Verify that operations are restricted to the test environment
- Document any new test cases or scenarios added

### Dependencies
- The project uses Python's standard library
- Any new dependencies must be clearly documented
- Maintain minimal external dependencies for security

## Key Files and Their Purpose
- `ransomware.py`: Contains the main educational simulation logic
- `test_files/meudocimportante`: Sample document for testing file operations
- `test_files/senhas`: Sample credentials file for testing data handling

## Warning
This is an educational project for learning about cybersecurity concepts. The code should never be modified for malicious purposes or used outside the controlled test environment.
